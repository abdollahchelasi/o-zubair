Image Credit: Omar Zubair Al Marzouqi Dubai: \u201cAll of my colleagues are far ahead of me in their professional careers. But I have what they don\u2019t, and they don\u2019t have what I do,\u201d shrugs Omar Zubair Al Marzouqi. The reality is such. While Al Marzouqi was busy pursuing his career graph as a handball official, his peers had, in the meantime, advanced to promotions as Majors, and one of them even as a Brigadier in the Dubai Police force. However, 20 years down the line in handball, these promotions really do not affect the 47-year-old First Lieutenant in the police force as he pushes sporting boundaries. At the 2012 London Games, Al Marzouqi was called on to referee at the handball competition. And now, four years later, he will be the only representative from Asia and Africa who will be at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games as an official technical handball delegate. Something he is proud of. \u201cSo what if I\u2019ve lost two ranks with the police force. I am very pleased with what I have achieved as a handball official,\u201d Al Marzouqi told Gulf News, as he prepared to depart for Rio next Wednesday for his second Olympic Games. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long and hard road for me. Before or after London, I have always worked hard in pursuit of my dreams. Last time it was as a referee. Now I will be a technical delegate. I will continue working hard and my dream will be to officiate at the handball final in Rio,\u201d Al Marzouqi related. No doubt, Al Marzouqi\u2019s rise as a handball official has been fuelled by his desire to succeed, and at the same time, give something back to the sport. \u201cMy next goal will be to be the chief referee in the UAE so that I am in a better position to help referees from my country raise their level and continue what I did in handball. This is life. The good work has to continue,\u201d he said. \u201cI have worked hard to reach this point. And now after this I will work even harder to help our referees reach greater heights. I want to be their teacher, and that to me, would be an ideal way to make my pay back to handball,\u201d he added. Al Marzouqi\u2019s initiation in handball was more deigned by chance than by choice. As an aspiring young footballer in the Al Nasr academy, Al Marzouqi chose to follow his group of friends into handball training after they \u201cwere promised a bag full of sports goodies\u201d. \u201cAt the end of our first handball training we were each given a full bag, and that made me stay back in handball even though I was not enjoying any of the sessions. However, after a month I began liking it, and since then it has been all the way forward,\u201d he recounted. It was in 1996 that Al Marzouqi made the switch from playing into refereeing. Since then, he has officiated at two IHF World Men\u2019s Handball Championship \u2014 in Sweden (2011) and Spain (2013) \u2014 and in the process become the only referee outside of Europe to official at a World Championship final. \u201cIt has been pretty simple for me. Handball has given me what perhaps no one else in UAE sports or in Asia has received. I feel proud of what I have achieved through my association with handball, and now I feel is the right time for me to give something back to my country and to the sport that has made all this possible,\u201d Al Marzouqi said. \u201cMy country will be the first thing on my mind when I land in Rio. There, I need to work hard and ensure I am the technical delegate for the final. That would be the best gift for the UAE,\u201d he added.
